🔍 Key Insights (Across All Locations)
1) Revenue Growth Is Consistent but Not Linear
All three locations show steady month-on-month growth from March to June.
February dip is consistent → likely seasonal or post-holiday slowdown.
June is the highest revenue month across locations.

Business Meaning:
The brand has strong demand momentum → ideal time to test pricing, bundles, or loyalty programs.

2)Morning Hours Drive Maximum Revenue
Peak sales consistently occur between 8 AM – 11 AM.
Revenue drops sharply post 4–5 PM, especially in Astoria and Lower Manhattan.

Business Meaning:
This is a morning-first coffee brand, not an evening café.

3) Coffee & Tea Dominate Sales Mix
Coffee + Tea contribute ~70–75% of transactions
Bakery and chocolate items are secondary but consistent add-ons.
Packaged / branded items have very low traction.

Business Meaning:
Core strength is fresh beverages, not retail products.
