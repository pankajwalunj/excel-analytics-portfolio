NYC Motor Vehicle Collisions Analysis 🚗📊
Project Overview
This project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on New York City motor vehicle collision data from January to August 2020. The goal is to identify temporal trends, high-risk periods, and key contributing factors behind road accidents, with a focus on generating data-driven safety insights.

Dataset
Source: NYPD Motor Vehicle Collisions (Open Data)
Time Period: Jan 2020 – Aug 2020
Scope: All reported motor vehicle collisions within New York City

Objectives
-Analyze monthly and hourly accident trends
-Identify peak accident times and high-risk periods
-Examine contributing factors behind collisions
-Compare patterns between fatal and non-fatal accidents

Key Insights
-Accidents peak during weekday rush hours (8–10 AM, 4–7 PM)
-Overall accident volume dropped during COVID lockdowns, but severity ratios increased
-Driver inattention/distraction was the most common contributing factor
-Speeding and failure to yield were more strongly associated with fatal crashes

Tools & Technologies
Advance excel analysis 

Results & Impact
The findings highlight how traffic volume, driver behavior, and time of day influence accident frequency and severity. These insights can support targeted enforcement, policy planning, and road safety initiatives.

Future Improvements
Extend analysis to multiple years for trend comparison
Add geospatial analysis using accident coordinates
Build a predictive model to estimate accident severity risk
